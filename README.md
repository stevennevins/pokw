# Proof of Kernel Work (PoKW)

## Introduction
Proof of Kernel Work (PoKW) is a consensus mechanism variant of the traditional Proof of Work (PoW). It focuses on a select group of nodes to participate in the mining process, aiming to reduce energy demands and maintain network security and integrity.

## Concept
PoKW restricts the mining competition to a small, randomly selected subset of nodes, termed the "kernel" of nodes. This approach reduces the number of nodes performing intensive computational tasks, thereby decreasing the energy required for mining activities.

## Mechanisms

### Dynamic White List
- A blockchain-authenticated list includes public keys of nodes eligible to participate in the mining process. This list ensures that only authorized nodes can contribute to the network's consensus mechanism.

## Security Enhancements in Leader Election
PoKW integrates the transaction gas price (`tx.gasprice`) into the entropy for randomness during the leader election process. This method adds an unpredictable, economically driven factor to the randomness, reflecting the competitive nature of transactions during high competition periods. This integration helps prevent nodes from influencing the leader selection process through predictable or manipulative actions, thus maintaining fairness and security.

## Benefits

### Energy Efficiency
- PoKW reduces the number of nodes involved in the mining process, which significantly lowers the energy consumption compared to traditional PoW systems.

### Security
- With fewer participating nodes, PoKW still upholds a secure network environment, ensuring the integrity and security of the blockchain.

## Conclusion
PoKW is a technical adaptation in consensus mechanisms focusing on energy efficiency and security in blockchain networks. It modifies traditional methods to accommodate fewer nodes, thereby reducing energy usage while maintaining robust security measures.
